The goal of our research is to develop a diagnostic model to identify pigmented and non-pigmented skin lesions in all ethnic skin types. An AI model for the diagnosis of skin lesions will augment the work of dermatologists in providing enhanced skincare services across various demographics; particularly in remote under-served communities, and others that are under-represented in specialist dermatological support. The model is a ranked classification of lesions in skin of color with deep neural networks using transfer learning and patch transformation with computer vision and GANs.
